Assignment 2: Industrial Robot Application Analysis

In automotive manufacturing‚Äîwhere tasks range from heavy-duty welding to delicate assembly‚Äîrobot selection hinges on precision, payload, workspace, and environmental compatibility. The two highly suitable robot types: Articulated Robots and Gantry Robots, both widely deployed across automotive plants.

ü§ñ 1. Articulated Robots (6-Axis Arms)
üîß Core Components
Component	Functionality
Rotary Actuators	Enable multi-axis movement for welding, painting, and assembly.
Encoders	Provide joint position feedback for precise control.
Force/Torque Sensors	Detect contact forces‚Äîessential for tasks like windshield installation.
Vision Systems	Used for part recognition, seam tracking in welding, and quality inspection.
Robot Controller	Manages kinematics, safety logic, and task execution.
End-Effector	Can be a welding torch, gripper, or spray nozzle depending on the task.
üõ† Application Enablement
‚Ä¢	Spot Welding: High payload and precision allow consistent welds across car body panels.
‚Ä¢	Painting: Smooth multi-axis motion ensures uniform coating.
‚Ä¢	Assembly: Torque sensors prevent over-tightening; vision ensures alignment.

üèóÔ∏è 2. Gantry Robots (Cartesian Robots)
üîß Core Components
Component	Functionality
Linear Actuators	Drive X, Y, Z motion across large workspaces.
Ball Screw or Belt Drives	Translate motor rotation into linear motion.
Vision Systems	Guide part placement and inspection over wide areas.
Robot Controller	Coordinates motion planning and I/O control.
End-Effector	Often a gripper or tool changer for handling parts.

üõ† Application Enablement
‚Ä¢	Machine Tending: Load/unload CNC machines or die-casting units with high repeatability.
‚Ä¢	Heavy Part Handling: Large payloads and workspace coverage for chassis or engine blocks.
‚Ä¢	Inspection: Vision-guided scanning of large components like doors or hoods.
‚öñÔ∏è Comparative Analysis: Articulated vs. Gantry Robots
Criteria	Articulated Robot	Gantry Robot
Precision	High (¬±0.02‚Äì0.05 mm); ideal for welding, painting	Moderate (¬±0.1 mm); sufficient for handling and inspection
Payload Capacity	Medium to High (up to 500 kg depending on model)	Very High (up to several tons with reinforced structure)
Workspace Needs	Flexible; compact footprint with wide reach	Large footprint; ideal for overhead or linear layouts
Speed	Moderate to High; optimized for dynamic tasks	Moderate; depends on actuator type and load
Flexibility	Excellent; multi-axis motion supports diverse tasks	Limited; best for linear, repetitive operations
Environmental Fit	Paint booths, welding cells, assembly lines	CNC zones, casting areas, large part inspection zones
Integration Complexity	Moderate; requires calibration and safety fencing	High; needs structural support and precise alignment
Best Use Cases	Welding, painting, assembly, screw-driving	Machine tending, heavy part handling, large-area inspection
Recommendation	‚úÖ Best for dynamic, multi-step tasks with precision	‚úÖ Best for large, heavy, repetitive tasks across wide workspaces

üß† Final Recommendation
‚Ä¢	Use Articulated Robots for flexible, high-precision tasks like welding, painting, and assembly‚Äîespecially where multi-axis motion and tool versatility are needed.
‚Ä¢	Deploy Gantry Robots for heavy-duty, large-scale operations like machine tending, die-casting, and inspection of oversized components.
