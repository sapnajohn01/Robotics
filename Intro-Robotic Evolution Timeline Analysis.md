Assignment 1: Robotic Evolution Timeline Analysis

üï∞Ô∏è Robotics Evolution Timeline:-

1. Ancient & Pre-Industrial Era (Pre-1900s)
Year	Milestone	Inventor/Entity	Significance
~300 BCE	Mechanical pigeon	Archytas of Tarentum	Earliest recorded automaton using steam propulsion
1495	Robotic knight	Leonardo da Vinci	Humanoid design with gears and pulleys
1738	Digesting Duck	Jacques de Vaucanson	Simulated biological processes‚Äîearly biomimicry
Robot Types: Automata 
Societal Needs: Entertainment, philosophical exploration of life and motion 
Ethical Considerations: None significant‚Äîrobots were novelties.

2. Early 20th Century (1900‚Äì1950)
Year	Milestone	Inventor/Entity	Significance
1921	Term ‚ÄúRobot‚Äù coined	Karel ƒåapek (play R.U.R.)	Introduced concept of artificial labor
1930s	Televox & Elektro	Westinghouse	Early voice-controlled and humanoid robots
Robot Types: Humanoid, entertainment 
Societal Needs: Public fascination, industrial optimism 
Ethical Considerations: Fear of dehumanization and loss of control

3. Industrial Revolution of Robotics (1950‚Äì1970)
Year	Milestone	Inventor/Entity	Significance
1956	Unimate	George Devol & Joseph Engelberger	First industrial robot‚Äîused in GM assembly line
1966	Shakey the Robot	Stanford Research Institute	First mobile robot with AI and decision-making
Robot Types: Industrial, mobile autonomous 
Societal Needs: Manufacturing efficiency, labor reduction 
Ethical Considerations: Job displacement, safety concerns in human-robot collaboration.

4. Rise of Intelligent & Specialized Robots (1970‚Äì2000)
Year	Milestone	Inventor/Entity	Significance
1979	Stanford Cart	Stanford University	Advanced vision-guided navigation
1986	ASIMO (concept)	Honda	Humanoid robot capable of walking and interacting
1998	AIBO	Sony	Robotic pet with emotional interaction
Robot Types: Service, entertainment, humanoid 
Societal Needs: Elderly care, companionship, consumer robotics 
Ethical Considerations: Emotional attachment, data collection, accessibility

5. Autonomous & AI-Driven Era (2000‚ÄìPresent)
Year	Milestone	Inventor/Entity	Significance
2002	Roomba	iRobot	Autonomous home cleaning robot
2012	Baxter	Rethink Robotics	Collaborative industrial robot (cobot)
2016	Sophia	Hanson Robotics	Social humanoid with conversational AI
2020s	Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics Atlas	Tesla, Boston Dynamics	Advanced mobility and manipulation

Societal Needs: Aging population, smart homes, precision surgery, logistics 
Ethical Considerations: Surveillance/privacy, algorithmic bias, autonomy in decision-making, human replacement
		
üîç Societal Influence & Ethical Reflection
Era	Societal Driver	Ethical Concern
Ancient	Curiosity & mimicry	None
Industrial	Efficiency & scale	Job loss, safety
Intelligent	Interaction & care	Emotional manipulation
Autonomous	Autonomy & data	Privacy, bias, accountability
