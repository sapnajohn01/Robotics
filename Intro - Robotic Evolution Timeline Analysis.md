Assignment 1: Robotic Evolution Timeline Analysis

🕰️ **Robotics Evolution Timeline:-**

**1. Ancient & Pre-Industrial Era (Pre-1900s)**\
|Year	|Milestone	|Inventor/Entity	|Significance|\
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
~300 BCE	Mechanical pigeon	Archytas of Tarentum	Earliest recorded automaton using steam propulsion\
1495	Robotic knight	Leonardo da Vinci	Humanoid design with gears and pulleys\
1738	Digesting Duck	Jacques de Vaucanson	Simulated biological processes—early biomimicry\
Robot Types: Automata\
Societal Needs: Entertainment, philosophical exploration of life and motion \
Ethical Considerations: None significant—robots were novelties.

**2. Early 20th Century (1900–1950)**\
Year	Milestone	Inventor/Entity	Significance\
1921	Term “Robot” coined	Karel Čapek (play R.U.R.)	Introduced concept of artificial labor\
1930s	Televox & Elektro	Westinghouse	Early voice-controlled and humanoid robots\
Robot Types: Humanoid, entertainment \
Societal Needs: Public fascination, industrial optimism \
Ethical Considerations: Fear of dehumanization and loss of control

**3. Industrial Revolution of Robotics (1950–1970)**\
Year	Milestone	Inventor/Entity	Significance\
